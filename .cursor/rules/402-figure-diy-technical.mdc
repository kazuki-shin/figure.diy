# Figure.DIY Technical Specifications Standards

<version>1.0.1</version>

## Context
- When documenting hardware components or technical specifications
- When describing system architecture, performance requirements, or hardware interfaces

## Requirements
- Include exact model numbers for all hardware components (e.g., "SO-ARM100", "reComputer J4012")
- Specify technical parameters with proper units (e.g., "19.5 kg·cm at 7.4V", "100 TOPS")
- Always include degrees of freedom (DOF) when describing robotic arms (e.g., "6-DOF")
- Specify computing platform with complete details (e.g., "NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB")
- Use standard terminology for AI frameworks:
  - "LeRobot" for robotics framework
  - "YOLOv8" for object detection
  - "Whisper ASR" for speech recognition
- Maintain consistent naming for hardware components:
  - "Arm-A" for leader arm, "Arm-B" for follower arm
  - "Jetson" or "Orin NX" for computing unit
  - "ReSpeaker" for audio input device
- Document all interfaces with specific types (e.g., "USB 3.2", "UART bus")
- Specify power requirements with exact values and units (e.g., "20W–40W")

## Examples
<example>
The **reComputer J4012 (Jetson Orin NX 16GB)** provides 100 TOPS of AI performance with 1024 CUDA cores. Each **SO-ARM100** offers **6-DOF** using *Feetech STS3215* servos at 19.5 kg·cm torque (7.4V).

This correctly specifies model numbers, technical parameters with units, and interface details.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
The Jetson computer provides high performance with many cores. Each robotic arm offers several movement options using servo motors with good torque.

This lacks specific model numbers, precise measurements with units, and detailed specifications.
