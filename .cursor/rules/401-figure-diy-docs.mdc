# Figure.DIY Documentation Standards

<version>1.0.1</version>

## Context
- When creating or editing Markdown documentation for the Figure.DIY project
- When updating project descriptions, technical documentation, or user guides

## Requirements
- Use "Figure.DIY" with exact capitalization (not "Figure.diy" or "figure.DIY")
- Structure technical documents with standard sections:
  1. Introduction
  2. System Architecture
  3. Requirements
  4. Interfaces
  5. Testing
  6. Future Considerations
- Bold key technical terms and capabilities using **double asterisks**
- Italicize emphasis points using *single asterisks*
- Format sections as "X. Section Title" with backslash before periods in Markdown links
- Use consistent component terminology:
  - "SO-ARM100" for robotic arms
  - "Jetson Orin NX" for computing unit
  - "ReSpeaker" for microphone array
  - "reCamera" for vision system
- Include reference links for external sources using standard Markdown format
- Always introduce hardware with full names first, then abbreviations in parentheses

## Examples
<example>
**Figure.DIY** uses two **SO-ARM100 robotic arms** (6-DOF) with the **Jetson Orin NX** processing unit to manipulate objects based on voice commands.

This correctly formats project name, hardware components, and uses appropriate emphasis.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Figure.diy uses 2 SO ARM100 arms with the jetson computer to manipulate objects.

This uses inconsistent capitalization, lacks proper emphasis, and omits technical specifications.
